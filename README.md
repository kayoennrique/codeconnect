# CodeConnect

Social network for developers called CodeConnect for the React course: components and JSX.

## üî® Project features

In this course, the CodeConnect login page will be developed, containing an image, an email and password form with titles and texts, a button to enter the application, links to remember a password or register.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Techniques and technologies used

The techniques and technologies used for this are:

- `React`: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- `React-DOM`: Package that allows the integration of React with the DOM element tree.
- `Babel`: Transpiler that converts modern JavaScript code into versions compatible with older browsers, in addition to allowing the interpretation of JSX codes.
- `JSX`: A syntax extension for JavaScript used in React, which allows writing HTML/XML code in a declarative and integrated way within JavaScript.
- `Componentization`: Design approach in which the user interface is divided into reusable and independent components.
- `Props`: Data passed from a parent component to a child component in React.
- `useState`: Hook in React that allows you to add state to functional components.
- `Event handling`: Action to respond to user interactions, such as clicks and key presses, in web applications.
